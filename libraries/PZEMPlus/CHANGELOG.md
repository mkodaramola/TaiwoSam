### Changed
- **PZEM003017 Separation**: Separated PZEM003017 into two distinct classes:

  - **PZEM017**: Derived class extending PZEM003 with current range functionality (50A-300A range, external shunt)
- **Error Return Values**: Changed error return values from `0` to `NAN` for floating-point measurement functions in PZEM003, PZEM017, and PZEM6L24
- **Return Type Optimization**: Updated return types to use appropriate integer types with sentinel error values:
  - `getAddress()`: `uint8_t` (returns 0xFF on error)
  - `getBaudrate()`: `uint32_t` (returns 0 on error)
  - `getConnectionType()`: `uint8_t` (returns 0xFF on error)
  - `getFrequency()`: `uint8_t` (returns 50 or 60 Hz, or 0 on error)

  - `setFrequency()`: Now accepts `50` or `60` directly (Hz) instead of `PZEM_FREQUENCY_*` constants
  - `setBaudrateAndConnectionType()`: Now accepts baudrate value directly (2400, 4800, 9600, etc.) with automatic validation
- **Documentation Structure**: Simplified documentation in .cpp files to only @brief, keeping full documentation (with @param and @return) in .h files
- **Access Specifiers**: Changed `_slaveAddr`, `_rxPin`, and `_txPin` from `private` to `protected` in PZEM003 to allow PZEM017 inheritance
- **Library Metadata**: Updated library.json and library.properties to include PZEM-014 and PZEM-016
